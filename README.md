# My-Coding-Journey
To be used as a portfolio, progress checker, inspiration and self-plagiarism source

Projects may and most likely will be written in various languages and some projects are assignments from classes I have taken.

projects for/from a class will be marked as "//Homework"

as a general rule of thumb Java and C++ projects are most likely class projects while Python and JavaScript projects will be personal in nature

details of each project and what was learned will be attached and made to be incredibly concise

Red.Java is a java class capstone project showcasing general Java and programming knowledge

yDownloader.py is a quick side project because my mom wanted a youtube downloader and isnt technologically capable
